Cerebras Systems Profile and Technology
1. Company Description
Category	Description
Mission	Cerebras Systems designs and builds the world's fastest AI infrastructure to accelerate deep learning and generative AI workloads, delivering unmatched speed and ultra-low latency.
Core Product	Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE): Their flagship processor (WSE-3) is the world's largest chip, built on a complete silicon wafer. It integrates all processing, memory, and communication fabric onto a single piece of silicon.
Main Offering	CS-3 System: The complete AI supercomputer system powered by the WSE-3, offering up to 125 Petaflops of AI compute and 44GB of on-chip memory.
Key Advantage	By eliminating the memory bottlenecks common in multi-GPU clusters, Cerebras provides up to 20x faster inference than traditional GPU solutions, critical for real-time and agentic AI applications.
Services	Provides AI supercomputing capacity on-premise (CS-3 systems) and in the cloud (Cerebras Cloud API) for enterprise and developer use.
